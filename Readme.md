# Practical Machine Learning
Using devices like Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit we can now collect a massive amount of data about personal activity. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movementâ€“a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech nerds.

The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they exercised. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with. You should create a report describing how you built your model, how you used cross validation, what you think the expected out of sample error is, and why you made the choices you did.
